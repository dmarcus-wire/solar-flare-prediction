## Data Source

1. NSO (National Solar Observatory) is a public research institute headquartered in Boulder, Colorado with a satellite facility in Maui, Hawai ªi. The mission of NSO is to advance our understanding of the Sun, both as a star and as a major influence for life on Earth.
    1. NISP is the NSO Integrated Synoptic Program that simply put, covers the entire visible disk of the Sun, and also extend for decades in time to observe several complete solar sunspot activity cycles. NISP operates two facilities:
        1. SOLIS (Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun)
        1. GONG (the Global Oscillation Network Group)
          1. A worldwide network of six identical telescopes, designed to have 24/7 observations of the Sun. The network serves multiple purposes, including the provision of operation data for use in space weather prediction, and the study of solar internal structure and dynamics using helioseismology.
            1. Big Bear Solar Observatory, California
            1. Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, Hawaii
            1. Learmonth Solar Observatory, Australia
            1. Udaipur Solar Observatory, India
            1. Observatorio del Teide, Canary Islands, Spain
            1. Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, Chile

### Observations

- EST (Eastern Standard Time). UTC (Universal Time). UTC is 4 hours ahead of EST. So, when it is  11:00 am EST it will be 3:00 pm UTC.
- Learmonth, Australia Avg. Magnetogram skips from 06:54 UT to 23:04 UT on 2024-02-22
